					<p class="analysis">Released on October 10th, 2019, Raison d'être is yet another collaboration between Eve and Mai Yoneyama. The music video follows two girls on named Raison and the other named D'être, the title of the song. Looking at the French translation, Raison d'être means "a reason to live," which is really fitting as Raison symbolizes the search to continue living and D'être symbolizes the ideal self of Raison. To keep things short and sweet, Raison d'être is mainly about how even though dreams can seem impossible to achieve, and they are never fixed and can be changed and adapted to fit in the real world.</p>

						<h2 class="songtitle">Kokoro Yohou (心予報)</h2>
						<p>English Title: Heart Forecast</p>

						<p class="analysis">Kokoro Yohou was released January 1st, 2020 just a few weeks before valentines day. This is fitting however, as this song was actually created as an advertisement for Lotte chocolate. The videos themes of bright and very pink landscapes go along with the main storyline of innocent hoghschool love. This also happens to be one of Eve's more light hearted songs as it is about three girls just being girls, chatting, hanging out, and all wanna confess to their crushes in their class with a valentine gift, just in time for the holiday of love.</p>

						<p class="analysis">Released on December 28th, 2022, Fight Song happens to be another one of Eve's songs to premiere in an anime; this time it happens to be as one of Chainsaw man's endings. Fight Song also happens to be a continuation of another one of Eve's songs, Inochi no Tabekata (How to Devour life). Another fun addition in this particular music video is that Eve decided to add some animated blooper scenes at the end of the video which are an enjoyable watch.</p>

					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="analysis">Yet another anime opening, Bokurano was released on Feburary 24th, 2023, and acted as the 11th opening for the anime My Hero Academia. In the music video, we can deduce that the main character, a boy, is sick but is able to keep going because a girl, the other main character in the song. The girl saves the boy and in turn the boy save the girl later on in the sing. Ultimately, Bokurano is about how we tend to people in their times of grief. </p>

						<h2 class="songtitle">Hanaarashi (花嵐)</h2>
						<p>English Title: Flower Storm</p>
						<div class="hover">
							<a href="https://youtu.be/I3ZozsgDDqI?feature=shared"><img class="coverImage" src="single5.png"></a>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="analysis">Released on October 1st, 2023, Hanaarashi is actually one of Eve's more straightforward songs. The MV was about the main character's, named Tsuno, journey to learn about the memories with her mom and to find out herself. On anther note, the world-building in this music video was on another level. The video has elements of fantasy as well as plays with colors to tell another masterful story yet again.</p>

							<a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/AdM5xUGC0bg?feature=shared"><img class="coverImage" src="single6.jpg"></a>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="analysis">One of Eve's more recent songs, Insomnia was released on February 29th, 2024 and doesn't have a music video to go along with it. There is an animated short, however it doesn't tell us too much information about the world the song is located in. However when we look into the lyrics, we can see that the song seems to be about a boy who passes through each day painfully yet refuses to give up and holds hope for his future.</p>
