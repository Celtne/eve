				<div class="about">
					<p>Eve began his career on the Japanese video-sharing service, Niconico on October 2009, posting covers of Japanese songs like "Tragic Boy" by Rainbow Girl.

				<div class="about">
					<p>Eve has been described as a person who breaks the wall between what's pop and rock. He experiments a lot with different genres, which can be seen throughout the music he has released over the years. His music has also been categorised as pop-rock or alternative-rock. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="about">
					<p>Eve is someone who likes to add an underlying philosophical meaning to all the art that they make. That becomes apparent when you take a look at any of his animated music videos. Not only is the art and cinemetography absolutely stunning, every single music video tells a story. The worlds that Eve creates in his music videos leaves the viewer in awe every single watch. However, Eve is one of those artists that doesn't reveal much about their songs and lets the audience make up their own interpretations or theories on the music.</p>
