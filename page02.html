					<p>First released on May 20th, 2017, Nonsense Bungaku centers around a young boy, named Bun, and his adventure set in a space found between the real world and the imaginary. This space is filled with creatures called Zingais, which are created from human emotions. ALthough there is no clear consensus of the music video, there is one very popular theory. In this theory, it is said that the main idea that Eve wants to imply is that his desire to sing is stronger than the logic behind why he sings (hence the Nonsense in the title). Many of the characters in the music videos were inspired by some of his childhood traumas. The events that the characters go through can be connected to Eve overcoming his trauma and the feelings of anger, sadness, lonliness, and despair he felt during that time </p>

					<p>Eve first released Dramaturgy on October 7th, 2017, and it eventually became one of his most popular songs. The song introduces us to the concept of dramaturgy, a sociological concept about the presentation  of oneself in everyday life. The song follows the main character, named Kurukuru, as he experiences the worst form of his dramaturgy. In the video, he has lost his sense of self but his body still  remains "trapped, suffocating on his tiny stage." He feels like he is not living the life he actually wants to live (something I'm sure many people can relate to). We eventually realize that Kurukuru's worst form of Dramaturgy is his fear that everyone will leave him which manifests itself in his social anxiety. As the video progresses however he begins to understand himself and learns to push his real self forward. Eve, through Dramaturgy, wants us to realize that we should shape ourselves the way we want to, instead of letting the world shape us, just as Kurukuru did. </p>

					<p>As You Like it was first released on Nov 29, 2017 and features bilateral music as certain parts of the song are isolated to one side of the ear. To sum up, As you Like it is about an identity crisis that was fueled by love and is Eve's take on the idea that "love is merely a form of insanity." the music video centers around a boy, a girl, and a zingai, named hand man. The boy can be seen coming up with all different situations where the girl rejects him, getting eaten by her, and falling in  love with hand man instead of him. The boy has four other selves which continue to cast these types of doubts on him and one of them just happens to be hand man. His selves lead him to rock bottom and the boy ends up having no confidence himself, even believing that pursuing his love is a crazy idea. In the end, the boy approaches the girl realizing that it's better to take the chance, rather than miss the opportunity. </p>
