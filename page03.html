					<p class="analysis">Released on November 20th 2020, Kaikai Kitan was set to be one of Eve's biggest hits. Kaikai Kitan was created to be the first openining to the hit anime TV series, Jujutsu Kaizen and was able to achieve over 100 million streams just within the first five months of being released. Because this song is partnered with a show, its meaning and storyline are a bit clearer than others. The the music video introduces us to all the characters, gives us bits of foreshadowing into the anime as well as, shows us how the main character grows as he follows his destiny. Furthermore, the title Kaikai Kitan, meaning "Cycle of Mystery," most likely alludes to the darkness and curses the characters deal with everyday. The cinematography on this particular video is absolutely stunning as well. The video showcases extremely detailed montagues and fluid movements as well as sets an eerie tone yet keeps up the hype for the show all done by the team behind this music video. </p>

					<h2>Yuseiboushi</h2>

					<p class="analysis">Yuseiboushi was released on September 10th, 2021 and is arguably one of Eve's most heavily artistry dense and story driven music videos. From the title, the viewer can discern that the song's overlying message is about living your life idly. The video features our main character, a red haired boy, who seems he would rather live in a dream until death than accomplish anything in his life. The next character we get introduced to is a white haired boy, who seems to be the red haired boy in the real world. When they first meet, they don't get along which could be seen as them suppressing each other's feelnigs. We learn of the red haired boy's emotional burderns and how he wants to create a dream where can share his feelings without showing weakness. This connects to Eve's own feelings as he felt he couldn;t express his feelings to anyone and used music as an outlet. From the dichotomy that the two boys bring, we can see that Yuseiboushi can be either a good or bad thing and it purely depends on the mindset that you hold. </p>

					<h2>Yoku</h2>

					<p class="analysis">First released on March 18th, 2022, Yoku is my personal favorite: both the song and music video. Yoku was created as an add for a limited time makeup line for the Kanebo Kate brand and features art and animation from the exceptional Mai Yoneyama. The music video features five different characters, all initially colored in gray monotone colors. However, their world becomes colorful when they finally decide to pursue their passion. In today's society people tend to do things to fit in and survive in the modern era, and lose sight of the beauty of the world around them. They depreciate the things they do, and end up living in a "gray colorless world." Yoku tells us to stop looking for a reason to do something and "love worthless things" you do. You don't need to stay in the box, and you don't need to compare yourself to others, just do what you love and appreciate every part of your life because in the end, you just need "you."" Not only does the video have a very motivational meaning, the art itself is a site to behold. I often come back to watch the video simply to appriecate the artistry put into the music video. The play with colors and light always tugs on my heart strings. Furthermore, the song itself evokes a sense of calm and never fails to put a smile on my face. People have also said that Yoku makes them feel like "you really want to live," and I just have to say that I completely agree.

					<p class="analysis">Shinkai was released on December 7th, 2020 and also happends to be apart of the soundtrack for the movie, Josee, the Tiger and the Fish. This music video features two girls, one white and one dark, and a huge cat. The cat was added simply because Eve wanted one. However the girls have a deeper meaning. According to the artist, the two girls are actually the same person; the one in white represents all the positive feelings the girl has, whereas the dark one represents her negative feelings. The two girls represnt the internal conflict that one may hold where the positive feelings are always chasing the negative ones in order to feel complete but the negative feeling wish to hide themselves away. Both girls can been seen wearing hearts on their chests that appear to just be blobs in the beginning. However, when they get close to each other the heart becomes more defined symbolizing how you need both positive and negative feelings in your life. Later on, we see a huge explosion which results in a city being destroyed. This could represent the consequences keeping in your eomtions wwhich leads into the overarching thesis of Shinkai: it's not only fine to cry but, actually a positive thing to let your negative feeling comes out</p>
